# Figma MCP Connection Test

## Status
- ✅ MCP Server Added: `figma-dev-mode-mcp-server`
- ✅ Server URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse`
- ✅ Connection Status: Connected
- ⏳ Waiting for MCP tools to be available in Claude Code

## Prerequisites Check
Please ensure:
1. [ ] Figma desktop app is running
2. [ ] You are logged into Figma
3. [ ] Dev Mode is enabled in Figma (if required)
4. [ ] The Figma file you want to work with is open

## Expected MCP Tools
Once properly connected, these tools should be available:
- `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__createFrame`
- `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__createText`
- `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__createRectangle`
- `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__setFills`
- `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__setStrokes`
- And more...

## Next Steps
1. Restart Claude Code if tools aren't showing
2. Check if Figma desktop app is running
3. Try opening a Figma file in the desktop app
4. Ensure the SSE server at port 3845 is running

## Test Commands
```bash
# Check MCP connection
claude mcp list

# Get server details
claude mcp get figma-dev-mode-mcp-server

# Remove and re-add if needed
claude mcp remove figma-dev-mode-mcp-server -s local
claude mcp add --transport sse figma-dev-mode-mcp-server http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse
```

## Ready to Implement
Once the tools are available, we'll implement:
1. Design System (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Component Library (buttons, inputs, cards)
3. Screen Designs (30+ screens)
4. Prototypes and interactions
